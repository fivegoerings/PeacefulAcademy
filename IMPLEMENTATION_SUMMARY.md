# Environment-Based Database Configuration Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented environment detection using both `NETLIFY_CONTEXT` and `NODE_ENV` environment variables to automatically determine which database environment to use based on the deployment context and platform configuration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Configuration Utility (`netlify/functions/db-config.mjs`)

Created a comprehensive configuration utility that provides:

- **Environment Detection**: Reads both `NETLIFY_CONTEXT` and `NODE_ENV` to determine current environment
- **Effective Environment Logic**: Combines both variables with priority (NODE_ENV overrides NETLIFY_CONTEXT)
- **Database URL Selection**: Automatically selects appropriate database URL based on effective context
- **Connection Management**: Provides utilities for creating and validating database connections
- **Environment Settings**: Returns environment-specific configuration settings
- **Logging**: Includes debug logging for environment information

### 2. Updated Database Functions

Modified both `netlify/functions/db.mjs` and `netlify/functions/api.mjs` to:

- Use the new environment configuration utility
- Automatically validate database connections
- Log environment information for debugging
- Apply environment-specific settings

### 3. Updated Drizzle Configuration (`drizzle.config.ts`)

Enhanced the Drizzle ORM configuration to:

- Use environment-specific database URLs for migrations
- Support different database environments for schema management
- Maintain compatibility with existing migration workflows

### 4. Environment Variable Support

The system now supports the following environment variables:

#### Platform Variables
- `NODE_ENV` - Platform environment (`prod`, `dev`, or other values)
- `NETLIFY_CONTEXT` - Netlify deployment context (automatically set)

#### Database Variables
- `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` - Production database URL
- `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_PREVIEW` - Preview environment database URL
- `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_BRANCH` - Branch deployment database URL  
- `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_DEV` - Development environment database URL

#### Fallback Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - Generic fallback
- `DATABASE_URL_PREVIEW` - Preview fallback
- `DATABASE_URL_BRANCH` - Branch fallback
- `DATABASE_URL_DEV` - Development fallback

## Environment Detection Logic

### Priority Order
1. **NODE_ENV=prod** → Forces production environment (overrides NETLIFY_CONTEXT)
2. **NODE_ENV=dev** → Forces development environment (overrides NETLIFY_CONTEXT)
3. **NETLIFY_CONTEXT** → Uses Netlify's deployment context

### Supported Contexts

#### Production (`production`)
- Triggered by: `NODE_ENV=prod` or `NETLIFY_CONTEXT=production`
- Uses: `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_URL`
- Settings: Production-optimized (10 connections, 30s timeout, security enabled)

#### Deploy Preview (`deploy-preview`)
- Triggered by: `NETLIFY_CONTEXT=deploy-preview` (unless overridden by NODE_ENV)
- Uses: `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_PREVIEW` → `DATABASE_URL_PREVIEW` → `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`
- Settings: Development-optimized (5 connections, 15s timeout, debug enabled)

#### Branch Deploy (`branch-deploy`)
- Triggered by: `NETLIFY_CONTEXT=branch-deploy` (unless overridden by NODE_ENV)
- Uses: `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_BRANCH` → `DATABASE_URL_BRANCH` → `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`
- Settings: Development-optimized (5 connections, 15s timeout, debug enabled)

#### Development (`development`)
- Triggered by: `NODE_ENV=dev` or `NETLIFY_CONTEXT=development`
- Uses: `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_DEV` → `DATABASE_URL_DEV` → `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`
- Settings: Development-optimized (5 connections, 15s timeout, debug enabled)

## Key Features

### Automatic Environment Detection
The system automatically detects the current environment using both `NETLIFY_CONTEXT` and `NODE_ENV` with priority logic, and applies appropriate settings.

### Fallback Mechanism
If environment-specific variables are not set, the system gracefully falls back to the production database URL.

### Connection Validation
All database connections are automatically validated before use, with proper error handling.

### Environment-Specific Settings
Different environments get different configurations:
- **Production**: Optimized for performance and security
- **Development/Preview**: Optimized for debugging and development

### Comprehensive Logging
Environment information is logged for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Testing

Created a test script (`test-env-config.mjs`) that verifies:
- Environment detection works correctly with both NETLIFY_CONTEXT and NODE_ENV
- NODE_ENV override logic works as expected
- Database URL selection follows the correct priority order
- Environment-specific settings are applied properly
- Fallback mechanisms work as expected

Run the test with: `npm run test:env`

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md` that includes:
- Setup instructions for environment variables
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Environment Switching**: No manual configuration needed for different environments
2. **Isolated Databases**: Each environment can use a separate database
3. **Security**: Environment-specific settings and proper fallback mechanisms
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new environments or modify existing ones
6. **Reliability**: Connection validation and error handling

## Next Steps

To use this implementation:

1. Set up environment variables in your Netlify dashboard
2. Configure separate databases for different environments (recommended)
3. Deploy and test the different environments
4. Monitor logs to ensure proper environment detection

The system is now ready to automatically handle different database environments based on both `NETLIFY_CONTEXT` and `NODE_ENV`!
